# Challenge: Redirecting Script Output


The goal of this challenge was to execute a script and redirect its output as input to another command (`/challenge/solve`), eventually retrieving the flag.

### Problem Breakdown
1. **Run a Script**: You were required to run a shell script, `x.sh`, which contains certain commands.
2. **Redirect Script Output**: Instead of just executing the script, you had to redirect its output into another command, specifically `/challenge/solve`.
3. **Capture the Flag**: After successfully redirecting the output, you would receive the flag.

### Step-by-Step Solution

#### 1. **Navigate to the Home Directory**
You navigated to your home directory, where the script `x.sh` is located:

```bash
cd
```

#### 2. **Execute the Shell Script (`x.sh`)**
You executed the shell script, which is likely designed to output some content that should be passed to another command.

```bash
bash x.sh
```

However, to complete the challenge, the output from `x.sh` needed to be piped (redirected) into another command.

#### 3. **Pipe (`|`) the Output to `/challenge/solve`**
You used the pipe operator (`|`) to take the output of `x.sh` and pass it as input to the `/challenge/solve` program:

```bash
bash x.sh | /challenge/solve
```

This command works as follows:
- `bash x.sh`: Runs the `x.sh` script.
- `|`: Takes the output of `x.sh` and sends it as input to the next command.
- `/challenge/solve`: Receives the output and processes it, resulting in the flag.

#### 4. **Receive the Flag**
Upon successful redirection, the `/challenge/solve` command provided the flag as output:

```
Correct! Here is your flag:
pwn.college{o1mTNwki2EWeAwHuAFAy9lWDoT2.dhTM5QDLwITO0czW}
```

### General Approach

1. **Run the script** (`x.sh`) that generates some output.
2. **Pipe the output** using the `|` operator to pass the result of the script to the next command.
3. **Invoke the second command** (`/challenge/solve`) to process the piped output.
4. **Receive the flag** as a result of correctly piping the output.

This demonstrates a typical approach to redirecting the output of one command or script as input to another in shell scripting.

```bash
hacker@chaining~redirecting-script-output:/home$ cd
hacker@chaining~redirecting-script-output:~$ bash x.sh | /challenge/solve
Correct! Here is your flag:
pwn.college{o1mTNwki2EWeAwHuAFAy9lWDoT2.dhTM5QDLwITO0czW}
hacker@chaining~redirecting-script-output:~$
```

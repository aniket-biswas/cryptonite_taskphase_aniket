## Challenge Overview

In this challenge, the objective was to read the contents of a file named `flag` located in the home directory using the `cat` command. This exercise focused on file reading and understanding the use of the tilde (`~`) as a shortcut to refer to the home directory.

   cat ~/flag
   ```

2. **Flag Retrieved**:
   The command successfully displayed the contents of the file, which included the flag:
   ```bash
   pwn.college{0NsrNUU2_-XFiff72XmZSuwGc1W.dFzN1QDLwITO0czW}
   ```



```bash
hacker@commands~cat-not-the-pet-but-the-command:/home$ cat ~/flag
pwn.college{0NsrNUU2_-XFiff72XmZSuwGc1W.dFzN1QDLwITO0czW}

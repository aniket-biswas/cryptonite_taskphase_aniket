# Challenge: Multi-Word Variables

In this challenge, the objective is to set an environment variable with multiple words and retrieve a flag as confirmation.

## Steps:

1. **Set the multi-word environment variable:**

    Use the following command to set the `PWN` variable to `"COLLEGE YEAH"`:

    ```bash
    PWN="COLLEGE YEAH"
    ```

    After setting the variable, you should see a confirmation message.

2. **Retrieve the flag:**

    Once the variable is set correctly, the output will be:

    ```
    You've set the PWN variable properly! As promised, here is the flag:
    pwn.college{w6qfYQiecg3KB3L5mF_auusrG3I.dBjN1QDLwITO0czW}
    ```

## Summary:

This challenge required setting an environment variable with multiple words using quotation marks. The successful setting of the variable returns a flag as confirmation of completion.
